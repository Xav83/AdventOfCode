## Problem

The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. They have a list of the dimensions (length `l`, width `w`, and height `h`) of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.

Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect <span style="color:green">right rectangular prism</span>), which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier: find the surface area of the box, which is `2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l`. The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.

For example:

- A present with dimensions `2x3x4` requires `2*6 + 2*12 + 2*8 = 52` square feet of wrapping paper plus `6` square feet of slack, for a total of `58` square feet.
- A present with dimensions `1x1x10` requires `2*1 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 42` square feet of wrapping paper plus `1` square foot of slack, for a total of `43` square feet.

All numbers in the elves' list are in feet. How many total <span style="color:white;text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black, 0 0 25px blue, 0 0 5px darkblue;">square feet of wrapping paper</span> should they order?
